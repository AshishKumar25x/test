                <h3>Our Motto</h3>
                <p>Our website is dedicated to making organ donation a seamless process for everyone. We provide a
                    simple and digital way to create a pledge form for organ donation. By filling out our user-friendly
                    form, you can officially declare your wish to contribute to saving lives.<br><br>
                    After completing the pledge, users are encouraged to submit their form to NGOs or the organ
                    transplant department of hospitals, along with a family witness to make it legally binding.<br><br>
                    In addition, we support users by generating an official PDF pledge certificate that can be
                    downloaded and submitted offline for registration. Our goal is to increase awareness and encourage
                    more individuals to become organ donors, helping save countless lives.</p>
